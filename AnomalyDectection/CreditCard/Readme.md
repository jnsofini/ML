# Credit Card Fraud. 
The project uses ML to train a model on some credit card transactions recorded in Europe for two days. The transactions are
classified as fraud or non-fraud. The data set is hosted on Kaggle and has 31 features, 28 of which have been anonymized 
and are labeled V1 through V28. The remaining three features are the time, amount of the transaction as well as whether 
that transaction was fraudulent or not. It is anonymous and the V's are actually the Principal Component Analysis.

We explore the properties of the data and check correlations and make plots of various histograms.
