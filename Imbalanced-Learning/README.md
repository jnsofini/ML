# Canada Motor Vehicle Collisions (1999 - 2017)

In real-world datasets, class imbalance is a common problem. An imbalanced dataset occurs when one class (called the majority, or negative class) vastly outnumbered the other (called the minority, or positive class). The class imbalance problem is manifested when the positive class is the class of interest. We have obtained a real-world dataset of motor vehicle collisions with an inherent imbalanced class problem.

##  Project objectives
- Understand the causes of fatal accidents on public road in Canada, e.g. the vehicle model, age group, road conditions, etc.

- Build a machine learning predictive model to classify fatal and non-fatal collisions.


##  Practice skills
In this project, we will learn the following  skills

- Data cleaning

- Exploratory Data Analysis

- Imbalanced learning & Cost sensitive method

- Under Sampling

- Synthetic Minority Over Sampling Technique (SMOTE)

-  Advanced classification models such as random forest classifier and XGBoost

- Precision Recall  (PR) Curve and Area Under the PR Curve (AUPR)

- Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve and Area Under the ROC (AUROC)
